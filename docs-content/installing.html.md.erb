1. Choose an availability zone to deploy singleton jobs.  

1. Choose extra availability zones to balance jobs.  To maximize uptime, balance as many jobs as possible across multiple AZs.

1. Choose the network to deploy Crunchy PostgreSQL to.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='install-postgres-conf'></a> PostgreSQL Configuration

You can tune Crunchy PostgreSQL in various ways to meet the demands of the apps that use it. This section provides guidance on how to tune these settings.

1. Click **PostgreSQL Configuration**.

1. Enter an integer for the **Max Connections** setting for PostgreSQL. This setting is the maximum allowed concurrent connections to the database. For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS).

1. Enter the amount of memory allowed for **Shared Buffers**. This sets the amount of memory the database server uses for operations. For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS).

1. Enter the amount of memory allowed for **Maintenance** processes such as **VACUUM** and **CREATE INDEX**.  
For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAINTENANCE-WORK-MEM).

1. Enter the number of **WAL Segments** that that are kept on the database servers, for replication of the write-ahead log (WAL).
For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-WAL-KEEP-SEGMENTS).

1. Enter the **Max WAL Size** before automatic WAL Checkpoint is activated.  
For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-MAX-WAL-SIZE).

1. Enter the **Max Worker Processes** to specify how many concurrent processes the system can support.
For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-WORKER-PROCESSES).

1. Enter the amount of memory allowed for **WAL Buffers**. This memory is used to store WAL that hasn't been written to disk yet. For more information, see the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-BUFFERS).

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='install-acceptance-tests'></a> Acceptance Tests Configuration

The Crunchy PostgreSQL tile deploys a test application to Cloud Foundry to verify the installation was successful. Perform the following steps to deploy the test application:

1. Click **Acceptance Tests Configuration**.

1. Enter an org name that already exists in Cloud Foundry. Use Apps Manager to find an org that already exists.

1. Enter a space name that already exists in Cloud Foundry. Use Apps Manager to find a space that already exists.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='install-resources-conf'></a> Resource Configuration

You can configure Crunchy PostgreSQL and its services to meet any application demand.  
Choose VM types for the PostgreSQL servers that make sense for your requirements.

1. Click **Resource Config**.
