In order to connect to an on-demand service from an external VPC, you must
ensure that the external VPC and PaaS VPC are peered. This process allows
traffic to be routed between VPCs. You may see connection timeout or connection
refused errors if the VPCs are not peered.

Additionally, the client IP address or subnet must be added to the `pg_hba`
configuration of the service instance. This can be accomplished during service
creation with the `hba_addresses` parameter or during service update with the
`add_hba_addresses` parameter.
