#### Using Cloud Foundry CLI

When the status of your service is **create succeeded** you can bind an app to
the service by running `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE`,
substituting `APP_NAME` with the name of your PCF app and `SERVICE_INSTANCE`
with the name of your service. For example:

```
cf bind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %>
cf restage myApp
```

If the app does not support SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, you
can optionally enable MD5 Auth methods at binding time:

```
cf bind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %> -c '{"use_md5_auth": true}'
cf restage myApp
```

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> You must restage or restart your app before it will have access to the service
credentials.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note: </strong>
MD5 Authentication is considered cryptographically broken.
Any and all efforts should be made to utilize SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication where possible.
