<p class="note warning"><strong>Upgrade Note:</strong>
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF can NOT be directly upgraded from v4 with PostgreSQL
9.5 to v5 with PostgreSQL 10.
</br>
Instead, it is recommended that a migration upgrade is performed, rather than an in-place upgrade.
Further information regarding migrations can be found in the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/crunchy/migration.html">Migration</a> section of the sidebar.
</br>
If continued support is needed for PostgreSQL version 9.5, please contact
Crunchy Data for PCF: crunchypcf@crunchydata.com.
For additional consulting assistance to plan a data migration effort, please
contact us at info@crunchydata.com.
