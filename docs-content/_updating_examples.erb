#### Using Cloud Foundry CLI

To update an existing on-demand service instance's configuration parameters, 
run `cf update-service SERVICE_INSTANCE -c SERVICE_PARAMS`, substituting 
`SERVICE_INSTANCE` with the name of your service, and `SERVICE_PARAMS` with
 a JSON object containing the parameters to update. For example:

```
cf update-service myService -c '{
    "add_hba_addresses": "192.168.0.24/32 192.168.1.0/24"
}'
```

To update the plan of an existing on-demand service instance, run
`cf update-service SERVICE_INSTANCE -p PLAN_NAME`, substituting `PLAN_NAME`
with the name of the desired service plan. For example, to switch to the
`general-monitor` plan:
```
cf update-service myService -p general-monitor
```

<p class="note">
New servers may be created and/or reconfigured when an on-demand
service is updated. Therefore, this step will take some time to complete. You
can check the status of your service my running <code>cf services</code> and
looking for <code>SERVICE_INSTANCE</code> or with
<code>cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE</code>.
