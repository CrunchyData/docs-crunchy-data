##<a id="02.090506.102"></a> v02.090506.102

**Release Date:** April 28, 2017

Features included in this release:

* On-Demand single-tenant service


<p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v2 relies on functionality 
released in PCF v1.9 â€“ v1.10 to provide support for "on-demand broker" capability.<br>
To implement this functionality, Crunchy Data has made material modifications to the 
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF manifest and does not currently provide a direct upgrade path from 
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v1 to Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v2. <br><br>
To avoid confusion between the two implementations, Crunchy Data has removed the 
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v1 from Pivotal Network.  
If you previously downloaded and deployed an evaluation copy of 
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v1, Crunchy Data is happy to provide ongoing commercial subscription support.<br><br> 
If you are interested in commercial subscription support for Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF, please contact sales@crunchydata.com.</p>
